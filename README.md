#  Traffic Sign Classifier


In this project, deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to classify traffic signs is used to classify traffic signs from the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset).

# Running the Traffic Sign Classifier in your local machine

## Set Up Your Environment

**CarND Starter Kit**
Install the car nanodegree starter kit if you have not already done so: [carnd starter kit](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit)

***TensorFlow***

If you have access to a GPU, you should follow the TensorFlow instructions for installing [TensorFlow with GPU support](https://www.tensorflow.org/install#optional_install_cuda_gpus_on_linux).

Once you've installed all of the necessary dependencies, you can install the tensorflow-gpu package:

`pip install tensorflow-gpu`

***Amazon Web Services***

Instead of a local GPU, you could use Amazon Web Services to launch an EC2 GPU instance. (This costs money.)

1. Launch an EC2 GPU instance with the udacity-carnd AMI.
2. Complete the Setup instructions.

## Opening the Project

1. [Download the dataset](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-selfdrivingcar/traffic-signs-data.zip). This is a pickled dataset in which we've already resized the images to 32x32.

2. Clone the project and start the notebook.

```
git clone https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier-Project
cd CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier-Project
```
3. Launch the Jupyter notebook:
`jupyter notebook Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb`
